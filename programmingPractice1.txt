Here are some practice problems to do so that you can familiarize yourself with programming and also
learn to think like a programmer does.

refer to the examples we did together!
**************EASY*******************
write a program the adds all the counting numbers between 1 and 10 (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
	modify this program to add all numbers between 1 and 10000.
	modify this program to ask the user an ending value and then add all numbers between 1 and the ending value.
		**possible problem**: if you are getting negative numbers as sums or numbers that you are sure are incorrect, it is likely your int variable is running out of memory.
		when an int runs out of memory, it overflows causing this strange behavior. 
		if you want to know more about variables overflowing: just ask me. I cant find a good article lol
		**what to do**: instead of declaring your variable an int, declare it as a long int or a long long int.	
		
write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of size 5.
	modify the program to find the minimum value
	
Write a program that takes the average of 10 values.
	(medium) modify your program to read in values from a file and average them. you will need to use fstream
			hint - refer to vectors and fstream example program
	(hard)	 modify your program to take an unknown number of values from a file and average them. you will need to use vectors
			hint - refer to vectors and fstream example program
					


**************MEDIUM*******************
write a program that can find the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 or 5 that are less than 1000.
hint: 	look up or experiment with the modulo operator (%) 
		9%3=0.
		
write a program that doesnt halt (until out of memory) and prints out the fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1. the next number can be obtained by adding the previous 2 numbers.
Therefore the begining of the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
to stop a program that is executing in command prompt, hold ctrl and press c.

(not a practice problem) if you enjoyed figuring out the solution to the 2 problems above, look up the euler project. tons of math/programming
	problems that get hard quickly. you already have a headstart. the first program is a euler project problem.

write a program that asks you for its name, a password or something. if what you tell it isnt what its looking for, it just asks again.
	if what you give it is what its looking for, it calls you a genius and then halts(program ends).

**************HARD********************
Write the Mastermind game. The game is as follows:
	there is a hidden sequence of colors either blue, green, red, or yellow. you can have more colors if you wish.(look up random or refer to randomName.cpp... or just ask me how to make a RNG)
	every turn, you guess a sequence. the game gives you 2 numbers back. 
		the first number is how many colors are correct and also in the correct location.
		the second number is how many colors are correct.
		
	make the sequence however long you want, but the real game has a sequence length of 4.
	if the correct sequence isnt guessed in n guesses, the game calls you a loser.
	n can be whatever you want, the lower the n, the more difficult.
